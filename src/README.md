📝 Reconstruction Note (2026)

This repository is a Reference Implementation of the original 2019 thesis project. Since the original source code was not preserved, the logic and architecture have been reconstructed based on the technical specifications and documentation in the published paper.

Key differences from the 2019 environment:

- SDK: While the original project used .NET Core 2.2, this reference code is maintained using a modern .NET SDK for compatibility and security.

- Language Syntax: The logic follows the C# 7.3 patterns described in the thesis, though minor modernizations in file structure have been applied for clarity in this repository.
